===Gene Sequence Parameters===
/users/bguang/scratch/homology-testing/tests/newstep/genesequences	// directory for out files
===Raw Reads Parameters===
/users/bguang/repos/barna/	// directory with flux simulator scripts
PRO_FILE // file to which simulated expression values are written
LIB_FILE // file to which expressed transcript molecules are written
	 // number of expressed RNA molecules simulated
0	 // expression: power law exponent
15,500	 // expression: a in exponential decay
15,500	 // expression: b in exponential decay
NaN	 // mean deviation of simulated transcription starts (NaN to deactivate)
NaN	 // scale parameter for poly-A tail lengths (Weibull distribution)
NaN	 // shape parameter for poly-A tail lengths (Weibull distribution)
false	 // switch reverse transcription on/off
false	 // switch fragmentation on/off
LIB_FILE_NAME	   // file from which fragments are read and to which new fragments are written
false		   // switches filtering for fragment sizes on/off
none		   // PCR distribution file. None disables
LIB_FILE_NAME	   // input file with set of fragments from which reads are amplified
SEQ_FILE_NAME	   // output file where genomic positions of sequenced reads are stored to
